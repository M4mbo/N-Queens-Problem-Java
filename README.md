# N-Queens-Problem-Java
This is my attempt on constructing a visual solution for the NP-complete N Queens problem using Java.

The N Queens problem is an extension of the famous 8 Queens problem. A solution for this problem requires to place N queens on an NxN chessboard without any two queens attacking each other. This program in particular gives an iterative implementation to the problem by using the stack ADT.
