# N-Queens-Problem-Java
This is my attempt on constructing a visual solution for the NP-complete N Queens problem using Java.

The N Queens problem is an extension of the famous 8 Queens problem. A solution for this problem requires to place N queens on an NxN chessboard without any two queens attacking each other. This program in particular gives an iterative solution to said problem by using the stack ADT.

Please change the relative path of the queen png file if needed.
